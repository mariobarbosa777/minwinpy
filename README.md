# minwinpy v 0.2.4
It's a library to work with minimized/inactive/background windows,
using win32 libraries, for direct communication.

tested with python 3 on vs-code and windows 10

run vs-code as admin like this https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36166551/85443510-f591a800-b556-11ea-9613-82a261f8ef6e.PNG , restart Windows and also run "your windows name" as admin

Look for examples on wiki (https://github.com/mariobarbosa777/minwinpy/wiki)
